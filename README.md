# firstPiOS

This repo will follow the "Baking Pi" lessons posted by the University of Cambridge. The lessons assume the use of the v1 Raspberry Pi board. Since, the only Pi I have on hand is the Raspberry Pi Zero W, I will be using this board instead. There will be some changes in the solutions for this reason.

The lessons can be found at this [link](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/index.html)
